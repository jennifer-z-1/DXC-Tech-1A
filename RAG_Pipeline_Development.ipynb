      "Introduction\n",
      "AI technologies are expected to bring a wide array of economic and societal benefits to a wide\n",
      "range of sectors, including environment and health, the public sector, finance, mobility, home affairs\n",
      "and agriculture. They are particularly useful for improving prediction, for optimising operations and\n",
      "resource allocation, and for personalising services.1 However, the implications of AI systems for\n",
      "fundamental rights protected under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, as well as the safety\n",
      "risks for users when AI technologies are embedded in products and services, are raising concern.\n",
      "Most notably, AI systems may jeopardise fundamental rights such as the right to non-discrimination,\n",
      "freedom of expression, human dignity, personal data protection and privacy.2\n",
      "Given the fast development of these technologies, in recent years AI regulation has become a\n",
      "central policy question in the European Union (EU). Policy-makers pledged to develop a 'human-\n",
      "centric' approach to AI to ensure that Europeans can benefit from new technologies developed\n",
      "and functioning according to the EU's values and principles. In its 2020 White Paper on Artificial\n",
      "Intelligence, the European Commission committed to promote the uptake of AI and address the\n",
      "risks associated with certain uses of this new technology. After having initially adopted a soft-law\n",
      "approach with the publication of its non-binding 2019 Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI and\n",
      "Policy and investment recommendations, the European Commission shifted towards a legislative\n",
      "approach, calling for the adoption of harmonised rules for the development, placing on the market\n",
      "and use of AI systems.\n",
      "Leading the EU-level debate, the Parliament called on the Commission to assess the impact of AI\n",
      "and to draft an EU framework for AI, in its wide-ranging 2017 recommendations on civil law rules on\n",
      "robotics. In 2020 and 2021, Parliament adopted a number of non-legislative resolutions calling for\n",
      "EU action,3 as well as two legislative resolutions asking the Commission to establish a legal\n",
      "framework of ethical principles for the development, deployment and use of AI, robotics and related\n",
      "technologies in the Union and harmonising the legal framework for civil liability claims and\n",
      "imposition of a regime of strict liability on operators of high-risk AI systems.\n",
      "In the past, the Council has repeatedly called for the adoption of common AI rules, including in 2017\n",
      "and 2019. In 2020, the Council called upon the Commission to put forward concrete proposals that\n",
      "take existing legislation into account and follow a risk-based, proportionate and, if necessary,\n",
      "regulatory approach.\n",
      "The Commission launched a broad public consultation in 2020 and published an Impact Assessment\n",
      "of the regulation on artificial intelligence, a supporting study and a draft proposal, which received\n",
      "feedback from stakeholders.4 In its impact assessment, the Commission identified several problems\n",
      "raised by the development and use of AI systems, due to their specific characteristics, namely:\n",
      "(i) opacity (limited ability of the human mind to understand how certain AI systems operate),\n",
      "(ii) complexity, (iii) continuous adaptation and unpredictability, (iv) autonomous behaviour, and\n",
      "(v) functional dependence on data and on the quality of data.\n",
      "AI regulatory approach in the world. An increasing number of countries worldwide are designing and\n",
      "implementing AI governance legislation and policies. While the United States of America (USA) had initially\n",
      "taken a lenient approach towards AI, calls for regulation have recently been mounting. The White House has\n",
      "released the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, a set of guidelines to protect the rights of the American public in\n",
      "the age of AI and President Joe Biden signed an executive order on AI in 2023. The Cyberspace Administration\n",
      "of China issued some guidelines on generative AI services, while the UK has announced a pro-innovation\n",
      "approach to AI regulation, which largely regulates AI via existing laws. At international level, the Organisation\n",
      "for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) adopted some non-binding Principles on AI, in 2019,\n",
      "UNESCO embraced a set of Recommendations on the Ethics of AI in 2021, the G7 agreed some International\n",
      "Guiding Principles on Artificial Intelligence in 2023 and the Council of Europe is currently finalising an\n",
      "international convention on AI. Furthermore, in the context of the newly established EU-US tech partnership\n",
      "(the Trade and Technology Council), the EU and the USA are seeking to develop a mutual understanding on\n",
      "the principles underpinning trustworthy and responsible AI.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Artificial intelligence act\n",
      "The changes the proposal would bring\n",
      "The draft AI act was designed as a horizontal EU legislative instrument applicable to all AI systems\n",
      "placed on the market or used in the Union, based on Article 114 and Article 16 of the Treaty on the\n",
      "Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) following the logic of the new legislative framework\n",
      "(NLF), i.e. the EU's approach to ensuring a range of products comply with the applicable legislation\n",
      "when they are placed on the EU market through conformity assessments and the use of CE marking.\n",
      "The Commission proposed enshrining in EU law a legal definition of 'AI system' referring to a range\n",
      "of software-based technologies using specific techniques and approaches ('machine learning',\n",
      "'logic and knowledge-based' systems, and 'statistical' approaches) that could be complemented\n",
      "through the adoption of delegated acts to factor in technological developments.\n",
      "The Commission also proposed to adopt a risk-based approach whereby legal intervention was\n",
      "tailored to concrete level of risk. Four categories were identified.\n",
      "First, the draft act proposed to explicitly ban the following harmful AI practices that are considered\n",
      "to be a clear threat to people's safety, livelihoods and rights, because of the 'unacceptable risk' they\n",
      "create:\n",
      " AI systems that deploy harmful manipulative 'subliminal techniques';\n",
      " AI systems that exploit specific vulnerable groups (physical or mental disability);\n",
      " AI systems used by public authorities, or on their behalf, for social scoring purposes;\n",
      " 'Real-time' remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for\n",
      "law enforcement purposes, except in a limited number of cases.5\n",
      "Second, the draft act proposed to regulate high-risk AI systems that create adverse impact on\n",
      "people's safety or their fundamental rights. The draft text distinguished between two categories of\n",
      "high-risk AI systems.\n",
      " Systems used as a safety component of a product or falling under EU health and safety\n",
      "harmonisation legislation (e.g. toys, aviation, cars, medical devices, lifts).\n",
      " Systems deployed in eight specific areas specified in Annex (e.g. law enforcement),\n",
      "which the Commission could update as necessary through delegated acts.\n",
      "Such high-risk AI systems would have to comply with a range of requirements particularly on risk\n",
      "management, testing, technical robustness, data training and data governance, transparency,\n",
      "human oversight, and cybersecurity before being placed on the market or put into service. AI\n",
      "systems that conform to new harmonised EU standards would benefit from a presumption of\n",
      "conformity with the draft AI act requirements.\n",
      "Third, AI systems presenting limited risk, such as systems that interacts with humans (i.e. chatbots),\n",
      "emotion recognition systems, biometric categorisation systems, and AI systems that generate or\n",
      "manipulate image, audio or video content (i.e. deepfakes), would be subject to a limited set of\n",
      "transparency obligations.\n",
      "Finally, all other AI systems presenting only low or minimal risk could be developed and used in\n",
      "the EU without conforming to any additional legal obligations. However, the proposed AI act\n",
      "envisaged the creation of codes of conduct to encourage providers of non-high-risk AI systems to\n",
      "apply the mandatory requirements for high-risk AI systems voluntarily.\n",
      "The proposal required Member States to designate one or more competent authorities, including a\n",
      "national supervisory authority, which would be tasked with supervising the application and\n",
      "implementation of the regulation, and proposed to establish a European Artificial Intelligence\n",
      "Board (composed of representatives from the Member States and the Commission) at EU level.\n",
      "National market surveillance authorities would be responsible for assessing operators'\n",
      "compliance with the obligations and requirements for high-risk AI systems. Administrative fines of\n",
      "3\n",
      "EPRS | European Parliamentary Research Service\n",
      "varying scales (up to €30 million or 6 % of the total worldwide annual turnover), depending on the\n",
      "severity of the infringement, were set as sanctions for non-compliance with the AI act.\n",
      "Some measures were tailored to foster investments. The Commission proposed that Member States,\n",
      "or the European Data Protection Supervisor, could establish a regulatory sandbox, i.e. a controlled\n",
      "environment that facilitates the development, testing and validation of innovative AI systems (for a\n",
      "limited period of time) before they are put on the market. Sandboxing would enable participants to\n",
      "use personal data to foster AI innovation, without prejudice to the GDPR requirements. Other\n",
      "proposed measures were tailored specifically to small-scale providers and start-ups.\n",
      "Advisory committees\n",
      "The European Economic and Social Committee and the European Committee of the Regions\n",
      "adopted their opinions in 2021 and in 2022, respectively.\n",
      "National parliaments\n",
      "The deadline for the submission of reasoned opinions on the grounds of subsidiarity was\n",
      "2 September 2021. Contributions were received from the Czech Chamber of Deputies and the Czech\n",
      "Senate, the Portuguese Parliament, the Polish Senate and the German Bundesrat.\n",
      "Stakeholder views6\n",
      "Definitions were a contentious point of discussion among stakeholders. The Big Data Value\n",
      "Association, an industry-driven international not–for-profit organisation, stressed that the definition\n",
      "of AI systems was quite broad and would cover far more than what is subjectively understood as AI,\n",
      "including the simplest search, sorting and routing algorithms, which would consequently be subject\n",
      "to new rules. Furthermore, they asked for clarification of how components of larger AI systems (such\n",
      "as pre-trained AI components from other manufacturers or components not released separately),\n",
      "should be treated. AmCham, the American Chamber of Commerce in the EU, suggested avoiding\n",
      "over-regulation by adopting a narrower definition of AI systems, focusing strictly on high-risk AI\n",
      "applications (and not extended to AI applications that are not high-risk, or software in general).\n",
      "While they generally welcomed the proposed AI act's risk-based approach, some stakeholders\n",
      "supported wider prohibition and regulation of AI systems. Civil rights organisations called for a ban\n",
      "on indiscriminate or arbitrarily targeted use of biometrics in public or publicly accessible spaces, and\n",
      "for restrictions on the uses of AI systems, including for border control and predictive policing.\n",
      "The European Enterprises Alliance stressed that there was general uncertainty about the roles and\n",
      "responsibilities of the different actors in the AI value chain (developers, providers, and users of AI\n",
      "systems). This was particularly challenging for companies providing general purpose application\n",
      "programming interfaces or open-source AI models that are not specifically intended for high-risk\n",
      "AI systems but are nevertheless used by third parties in a manner that could be considered high-\n",
      "risk. They also called for 'high-risk' to be redefined, based on the measurable harm and potential\n",
      "impact. AlgorithmWatch underlined that the applicability of specific rules should not depend on the\n",
      "type of technology, but on the impact it has on individuals and society. They called for the new rules\n",
      "to be defined according to the impact of the AI systems and recommend that every operator should\n",
      "conduct an impact assessment that assesses the system's risk levels on a case-by-case basis. Climate\n",
      "Change AI called for climate change mitigation and adaptation to be taken into account in the\n",
      "classification rules for high-risk AI systems and impose environmental protection requirements.\n",
      "The European Consumer Organisation, BEUC, stressed that the proposal required substantial\n",
      "improvement to guarantee consumer protection. The organisation argued that the proposal\n",
      "should have a broader scope and impose basic principles and obligations (e.g. on fairness,\n",
      "accountability and transparency) upon all AI systems, as well as prohibiting more comprehensively\n",
      "harmful practices (such as private entities' use of social scoring and of remote biometric\n",
      "4\n",
      "Artificial intelligence act\n",
      "identification systems in public spaces). Furthermore, consumers should be granted a strong set of\n",
      "rights, effective remedies and redress mechanisms, including collective redress.\n",
      "There were opposing views on the impact of the proposed regulation on investment. A study by\n",
      "the Centre for Data Innovation (representing large online platforms) highlighted that the\n",
      "compliance costs incurred under the proposed AI act would likely provoke a chilling effect on\n",
      "investment in AI in Europe, and could particularly deter small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)\n",
      "from developing high-risk AI systems. According to the study, the AI act would cost the European\n",
      "economy €31 billion over the next five years and reduce AI investments by almost 20 %. However,\n",
      "such estimates of the compliance costs were challenged by the experts from the Centre for\n",
      "European Policy Studies, as well as by other economists. The European Digital SME Alliance warned\n",
      "against overly stringent conformity requirements, and asked for effective SME representation in the\n",
      "standards-setting procedures and for mandatory sandboxes in all EU Member States.\n",
      "Academic and other views\n",
      "While generally supporting the Commission's proposal, critics called for amendments, including\n",
      "revising the 'AI systems' definition, ensuring a better allocation of responsibility, strengthening\n",
      "enforcement mechanisms and fostering democratic participation.7 Among the main issues were:\n",
      "AI systems definition\n",
      "The legal definition of 'AI systems' contained in the proposed AI act has been heavily criticised.\n",
      "Smuha and others warned the definition lacks clarity and may lead to legal uncertainty, especially\n",
      "for some systems that would not qualify as AI systems under the draft text, while their use may have\n",
      "an adverse impact on fundamental rights.8 To address this issue, the authors proposed to broaden\n",
      "the scope of the legislation to include explicitly all computational systems used in the identified\n",
      "high-risk domains, regardless of whether they are considered to be AI. Ebers and others consider\n",
      "that the scope of 'AI systems' was overly broad, which may lead to legal uncertainty for developers,\n",
