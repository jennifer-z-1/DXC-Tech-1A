EU AI Act PDF Parsing and Embedding with Cohere in Google Colab
This project demonstrates how to parse and extract relevant information from the EU AI Act PDF using Python in Google Colab. It involves extracting text from the PDF, chunking the text for better embedding handling, and using Cohere to generate embeddings for document chunks. These embeddings are then indexed with FAISS to allow efficient similarity search for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) use cases.
