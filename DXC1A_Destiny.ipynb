AI \\nsystems that conform to new harmonised EU standards  would benefit from a presumption of \\nconformity with the draft AI act requirements. \\nThird, AI systems presentin g limited risk , such as systems that interacts with humans (i.e. chatbots), \\nemotion recognition systems, biometric categorisation systems, and AI systems that generate or \\nmanipulate image, audio or video content (i.e. deepfakes ), would be subject to a limi ted set of \\ntransparency obligations.', '  \\nThe Commission launched a broad public consultation  in 2020 and published an  Impact Assessment \\nof the regulation on artificial intelligence, a  supporting study  and a draft proposal , wh ich received \\nfeedback  from stakeholders.4 In its impact assessment, the Commission identifie d several problems  \\nraised by the development and use of AI systems, due to their specific characteristics , namely:  \\n(i) opacity (limited ability of the human mind to understand how certain AI systems operate), \\n(ii) complexity, (iii)  continuous adaptation and unpredictability, (iv)  autonomous behaviour, and \\n(v)  functional dependence on data and on the quality of data.  \\nAI regulatory approach in the world . An increasing number of countries  worldwide are designing and \\nimplementing AI governance legislation and policies . While the United States of America (USA) had initially \\ntaken a lenient approach towards AI, calls  for regulation have recen tly been mounting.', \"23 Helberger and others call for  the AI act to be complemented by  an \\nadditional set of exercisable rights to protect citizens from  AI-generated harm, with additional legislation to Artificial intelligence act  \\n11 control the potential environmental impact of training AI models and protect worker's rights and to define \\nfurther a set of requirements that research organisations must comply with to benefit from the research \\nexemption.24 Also, some argue  that the AI act d oes not go far enough in preventing and/or mitigating the \\nspecific risks associated with chatbots. T imely standardisation will be key to ensur ing adequate \\nimplementation of the AI act, for instance, to ensure the robustness of high -risk AI systems and the \\nwatermarking  of AI -generated content while, in the meantime, the EU is fostering the adoption of voluntary \\ncodes of conduct  and of an AI Pact  to mitigate the potential downsides of generative AI.\", \"8 To address this issue, the authors propose d to broaden \\nthe scope of the legislation  to include explicitly all computational systems used in the identified \\nhigh -risk domains, regardless of whether they are considered to be AI. Ebers and others consider  \\nthat the scope of ' AI systems'  was overly broad, which may lead to legal uncertainty  for developers, \\noperators, and users of AI systems and ultimately to over -regulation.9 They c alled on EU law -makers \\nto exempt AI systems developed and used for research purposes  and open -source software  (OSS) \\nfrom regulation. Other commentators question ed whether the proposed definition of ' AI systems'  \\nis truly technology neutral  as it refers primarily to ' software ', omitting potential future AI \\ndevelopments. \\nRisk -based approach  \\nAcademics also call ed for amendments, warning that the risk -based approach proposed by the \\nCommission would not ensure a high level of protection of fundamental rights.\", \" The \\nEuropean Parliament 's LIBE and IMCO committees endorsed  the final text  in a joint vote on \\n13 February  2024, with an overwhelming majority (71  votes in favour, 8  votes against and \\n7 abstentions).  The European Parliament will now vote on the final agreement on the AI act at the \\nMarch  2024 plenary  session, before it is endorsed by Council ands published in the EU's Official \\nJournal.

AI \\nsystems that conform to new harmonised EU standards  would benefit from a presumption of \\nconformity with the draft AI act requirements. \\nThird, AI systems presentin g limited risk , such as systems that interacts with humans (i.e. chatbots), \\nemotion recognition systems, biometric categorisation systems, and AI systems that generate or \\nmanipulate image, audio or video content (i.e. deepfakes ), would be subject to a limi ted set of \\ntransparency obligations.', '  \\nThe Commission launched a broad public consultation  in 2020 and published an  Impact Assessment \\nof the regulation on artificial intelligence, a  supporting study  and a draft proposal , wh ich received \\nfeedback  from stakeholders.4 In its impact assessment, the Commission identifie d several problems  \\nraised by the development and use of AI systems, due to their specific characteristics , namely:  \\n(i) opacity (limited ability of the human mind to understand how certain AI systems operate), \\n(ii) complexity, (iii)  continuous adaptation and unpredictability, (iv)  autonomous behaviour, and \\n(v)  functional dependence on data and on the quality of data.  \\nAI regulatory approach in the world . An increasing number of countries  worldwide are designing and \\nimplementing AI governance legislation and policies . While the United States of America (USA) had initially \\ntaken a lenient approach towards AI, calls  for regulation have recen tly been mounting.', \" Further more, they ask ed for clarification of how components of larger AI systems (such \\nas pre -trained AI components from other manufacturers or components not released separately), \\nshould be treated. AmCham, the American Chamber of Commerce in the EU, suggest ed avoiding \\nover -regulation by adopting a narrower definition of AI systems, focusing strictly on high -risk AI \\napplications (and not extended to AI applications that are not high -risk, or software in general).  \\nWhile they generally welcome d the proposed AI act 's risk -based approach , some stakeholders \\nsupport ed wider prohibition and regulation of AI systems. Civil rights organisations call ed for a ban \\non indiscriminate or arbitrarily targeted use of biometrics in public or publicly accessible spaces, and for restrictions on the uses of AI systems, including for border control and predictive policing.\", \"  \\nFinally, all other AI systems presenting only low or minimal risk  could be developed and used in \\nthe EU without conforming to any additional legal obligations. However, the proposed AI act \\nenvisage d the creation of codes of conduct  to encourage providers of non- high -risk AI systems to \\napply the mandatory requirements for high- risk AI systems voluntarily . \\nThe proposal required  Member States to designate one or more competent authorities, including a \\nnational superviso ry authority , which would be tasked with supervising the application and \\nimplementation of the regulation, and  proposed to establish  a European Artificial Intelligence \\nBoard  (composed of representatives from the Member States and the Commission) at EU level. \\nNational market surveillance authorities  would be responsible for assessing operators ' \\ncompliance with the obligations and requirements for high- risk AI systems.\", \"8 To address this issue, the authors propose d to broaden \\nthe scope of the legislation  to include explicitly all computational systems used in the identified \\nhigh -risk domains, regardless of whether they are considered to be AI. Ebers and others consider  \\nthat the scope of ' AI systems'  was overly broad, which may lead to legal uncertainty  for developers, \\noperators, and users of AI systems and ultimately to over -regulation.9 They c alled on EU law -makers \\nto exempt AI systems developed and used for research purposes  and open -source software  (OSS) \\nfrom regulation. Other commentators question ed whether the proposed definition of ' AI systems'  \\nis truly technology neutral  as it refers primarily to ' software ', omitting potential future AI \\ndevelopments. \\nRisk -based approach  \\nAcademics also call ed for amendments, warning that the risk -based approach proposed by the \\nCommission would not ensure a high level of protection of fundamental rights.\"]\n"
